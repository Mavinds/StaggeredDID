# Staggered-Matching-Approach-Framework
This code is for reproducing the Staggered Matching Approach proposed in the paper "Causal spillover effects of electric vehicle charging station placement on local businesses: a staggered adoption study" by M. Mavin De Silva, Callie Clark, Nakayama Tadachika, and Takahiro Yabe.

The following Jupyter notebooks are accompanied by Placer.Ai data (TotalPOIs_within400m.csv and CityMatchedPOIsCleanedforDID.csv) to test the methods used in the study.
